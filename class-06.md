## Problem Domain

What is the problem domain? The problem domain is the scope of the current project you are working on. It is the topics that are directly related to whatever specific piece of code you are working on. Say for example that you are working on writing code for medical databases. The problem domain would be things related to the medical field, medical research or maybe patient information. If you're making a website for selling photography services, the problem domain is photography and e-commerce. Basically it's all of the stuff not related to the code you are writing but things you still need to understand to be able to effectively write your code.

## JavaScript and JQuery Chapter 3: Objects

Objects in JavaScript are containers that group together variables and functions and allow you to access all or part as needed. Inside of an object, variable are called properties and functions are called methods. The properties and methods inside of an object are made up of key-value pairs. An object can't have a ket with more than one value similar to how each door of an apartment building has a specific key that allows entry into its corresponding room. 

## JavaScript and JQuery Chapter 5: Document Object Model

DOM stands for Document Object Model. The DOM tells the browser how to create a model of the HTMl elements and how JavaScript interacts with the model. The DOM model is referred to as a 'tree'. A DOM tree has four types of nodes:
* Document nodes
* Element nodes
* Attribute nodes
* Text nodes

Elements can be accessed specifically from the DOM tree using ID or class selectors, by tag name, or by using CSS selectors. Once a node has been selected, you can specify changes to its properties. You can also manipulate the child element, parent element or sibling element of a specified node. Node values can be stored in variables for easier access.
