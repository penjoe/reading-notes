## The <canvas> element:

* `<canvas>` is a built in API in html used for rendering drawings onto the page
the `<canvas>` element acts much like an `<img>` element
* fallback content can easily be provided for browsers that don't support `<canvas>`
* `<canvas>` creates a fixed-size drawing surface
* javascript is used by `<canvas>` to render content drawn 
* `<canvas>` supports two shapes, rectangles and paths
* paths are lists of points connected by lines
* drawing is done reerencing an x,y grid inside of the `<canvas>`
* 'drawing' with the `<canvas>` element is done with a series of javascript functions that all set paths for the `drawing` to be accomplished
* color can be applied using CSS color values once a drawing has been rendered 
* aside from colors, there are many other aspects of the rendered drawing that can be styled
* text can also be drawn and styled using `<canvas>`
